# CodingCampGames
These are the games I made for the coding camp (Code-It Hacks) which I worked at during the summer of 2021. These games are meant to help teach children coding.

The first game I made was Dungeons and Dragons themed. It was also the first game I ever made in Pygame. It is under the folder "DungeonsAndDragons".

The second game I made was based on a space theme. I decided to make it like a super simplified version of something like minion rush/subway surfer.
