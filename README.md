# CodingCampGames
These are the games I made for the coding camp (Code-It Hacks) which I worked at during the summer of 2021. These games are meant to help teach children coding.

The first game I made was Dungeons and Dragons themed. It was also the first game I ever made in Pygame. It is under the folder "DungeonsAndDragons".

The second game I made was based on a space theme. I decided to make it like a super simplified version of something like minion rush/subway surfer. It is under the folder "VoyageToTheLostGalaxy".

The third game I made was based on pokemon and inspired by games like flappy bird or birds life. It is under the folder "Pokemon".

The fourth game I made was a short puzzle game for a 4 day week. It is meant to more teach the logic than other games, but I enjoyed giving it a complete aesthetic.

The fifth game is for a full day camp (previous camps were half day). It has two phases and uses the better method of using surfaces/rects for collision. The first phase is based on flappy bird and the second on lunar lander.
