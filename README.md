# CodingCampGames
These are the games I made for the coding camp (Code-It Hacks) which I worked at during the summer of 2021. These games are meant to help teach children coding.

The first game I made was Dungeons and Dragons themed. It was also the first game I ever made in Pygame. It is under the folder "DungeonsAndDragons".

The second game I made was based on a space theme. I decided to make it like a super simplified version of something like minion rush/subway surfer. It is under the folder "VoyageToTheLostGalaxy".

The third game I made was based on pokemon and inspired by games like flappy bird or birds life. It is under the folder "Pokemon".

The fourth game I made was a short puzzle game for a 4 day week. It is meant to more teach the logic than other games, but I enjoyed giving it a complete aesthetic.

The fifth game is for a full day camp (previous camps were half day). It has two phases and uses the better method of using surfaces/rects for collision. The first phase is based on flappy bird and the second on lunar lander.

The sixth game is themed around wizards and harry potter. It is meant for a half day camp, but could be expanded to a full day camp quite easily. From this game on I'm expecting to use mostly the rect system. However, without classes, this can result in some messier code.

The seventh is inspired by the classic game: Asteroids, but is also similar to the second game. The goal behind this was to make a more definitive version as well as apply the use of rects to a similar concept. For advanced students, I would modify it to use classes instead of multiple lists per object.

For the 2nd last game I wanted to get creative. I was inspired by the idea of an aim trainer and wanted to make something to test the reflexes. I also wanted to make a game completely different from any other week!

Then I designed a game around some themes some students gave me in the fall (so that they could design their own game without having to design it and then I could lead them through the process). This game is MedievalBash and is in my opinion the best coded out of all the games. It features a shop and a dungeon mode and impliments complete 2d movement (pokemon style).

If you were to teach one game, I would reccomend either Medieval Bash or the fifth game.
The fifth game would probably be better for beginners, but for intermediate students wanting to learn classes, Medieval Bash should be the right amount of challenge.
